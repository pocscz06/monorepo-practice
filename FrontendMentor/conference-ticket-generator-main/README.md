## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Complete the form with their details
- Receive form validation messages if:
  - Any field is missed
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
  - The avatar upload is too big or the wrong image format
- Complete the form only using their keyboard
- Have inputs, form field hints, and error messages announced on their screen reader
- See the generated conference ticket when they successfully submit the form
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**


## My process

I wanted to use this to practice proper application of most of what I've been learning recently:

- Semantic HTML markup
  - A11y/ARIA Guidelines
- CSS Vars, Resetting, Nesting, & Container Queries for:
  - Responsive Design
  - Maintainability/Scalability
- Nifty CSS selectors to get more comfortable with them
  - Lobotomized Owl Selector ( > * + *)
  - Children Pseudoclass Selector (.hidden-btns > *:hover)
  - etc.


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Vanilla CSS Vars, Reset, & Nesting
- JavaScript
- Flexbox
- Drag and Drop Web API

**Note: These are just examples. Delete this note and replace the list above with your own choices**

### What I learned

Throughout this process, I sifted through a ton of different resources through which I learned a handful of different things:

- HTML Drag and Drop Web API
- Container Queries
  - Using "conditionals" within media/container queries (i.e., `width < 560px`)
- CSS `&` syntax
- CSS `@layer` directive for "creating cascade layers"
- `@media (hover)` query

### Continued goals

- Learning BEM Methodology for class naming
- Continue learning A11y/ARIA
- Continue Semantic HTML practice
- Improve on responsive design
  - Perhaps adopt mobile-first design approach
- Hard focus on maintainable/scalable code

### Continued development

### Useful resources
