## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

I'll be taking this on with a mobile-first approach. So I'll modify the HTML structure to follow the provided mobile design if it isn't already.

I still haven't looked into the BEM methodology yet, but I'll attempt it for this assignment anyways and just learn as I go. From what I gather of BEM:

- Block (main component)
- Elements (part of the block) prefaced with double underscore `__`
- Modifiers (denoting a state of the element) prefaced with double hyphen `--`

It kind of seems like BEM's primary focus is on readability in working with teams? It is very straightforward--but it also seems like it sacrifices some reusability in that regard? Though I could just add some utility classes as needed. I like maximizing readability.

In regards to the CSS, I'll be experimenting with nesting (though I have doubts on whether or not nesting is a good idea with BEM methodology) and the layer directive here. If I stick with nesting, I should go no deeper than two nests. I'll also be using media queries as needed.

I'll use Flexbox for the navbar/header, and grid for the main content.
