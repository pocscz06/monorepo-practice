# Notes:

- By default, most elements will have a width of 100% its parent.
- Avoid the `height` property when applicable. Rather, avoid unnecessary styling. Often, new frontend devs will try certain styling, see that it's not working as intended, and start adding new properties and changing values. The Web generally _wants_ to be responsive by default.
